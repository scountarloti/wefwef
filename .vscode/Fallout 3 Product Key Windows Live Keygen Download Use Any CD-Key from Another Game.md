## Step 1: Check your Steam library for a CD key
 
If you bought Fallout 3 through Steam, you may have a CD key that you can use to activate the game on Windows Live. To check if you have one, go to your Steam library, right-click on Fallout 3, and select "View CD Key". If you see a key, copy it and paste it when Windows Live asks for it. If you don't see a key, or if it says "Requesting Key", move on to the next step.
 
## Step 2: Disable Windows Live with a mod
 
One of the easiest ways to play Fallout 3 without Windows Live is to use a mod that disables it. You can download one from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/1086). Extract the zip file and run the G4WL disabler.exe. Click on "Disable G4WL" and exit. This will prevent Windows Live from launching when you start the game.
 
## Step 3: Install compatibility patches and fixes
 
Fallout 3 may not run well on newer versions of Windows, such as Windows 7, 8, or 10. To fix this, you will need to install some patches and fixes that improve the game's stability and performance. You can find a comprehensive guide on how to do this [here](https://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/828937546147175081/). Some of the most important steps are:
 
- Install the latest official patch from [here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/games/fallout-3).
- Install the unofficial patch from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/19122).
- Edit the fallout.ini file in your Documents\My Games\Fallout3 folder and change bUseThreadedAI=0 to bUseThreadedAI=1 and add iNumHWThreads=2 below it.
- Run the game in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3 and as an administrator.
- Disable any overlays or background programs that may interfere with the game.

## Step 4: Enjoy Fallout 3!
 
Once you have done all the steps above, you should be able to play Fallout 3 without a product key or Windows Live. You can also install mods and save your progress normally. If you have any issues or questions, you can check out the [Fallout 3 Steam forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/) for more help and tips. Have fun exploring the wasteland!
